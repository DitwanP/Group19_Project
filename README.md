CEN4010 Group Project - Group 19
Bookstore web app project for CEN4010.

Team Project CEN 4010
120 points
You will be creating an online web application bookstore which targets a particular niche in technology. The application,
named Geek Text (think of Thinkgeek meets Barnes and noble) will need to support the following features:
Feature
ID
Feature Benefit
1 Book Browsing and
Sorting
Users will have a simple and enjoyable way to discover new books and
Authors and sort results.
DESCRIPTION: Allow user to browse books by genre, top sellers in our
book store, and book rating with pagination based on 10 or 20 results. Allow Sort by
book title, author, price, book rating, and release date.
2 Profile
Management
Users can create and maintain their profiles rather than enter in
their information each time they order
DESCRIPTION: Users can manage their login credentials (ID,
password), personal information (name, email address, home
address), nickname for book rating and commenting, credit card
information (multiple), and shipping address (multiple). Physical
addresses, email addresses, and credit card info should be
verified as valid. Passwords must meet our current security
standards
3 Shopping Cart Users can manage items in a shopping cart for immediate or future
Purchase
DESCRIPTION: Users can easily access their cart from any page, view
the same information displayed in the book list, change the quantity,
remove it from their cart or save it for later. A subtotal for all items in
their shopping cart should be displayed at the bottom. Items saved for
later should appear below that.
4 Book Details Users can see informative and enticing details about a book
DESCRIPTION: Display book name, book cover (which can be enlarged
when clicked), author and bio, book description, genre, publishing info
(publisher, release date, etc.), book rating, and comments. Hyperlink
author’s name to a list of other books by the same author.
5 Book Rating and
Commenting
Users can rate AND comment on books they’ve purchased to help others in their
selection
DESCRIPTION: For Rating: Use a five-star rating system. Users can only rate a book
if they’ve purchased it, and may select whether they show their nickname
(defined in their profile) or remain anonymous. For Commenting: A single comment
should be limited to the number of
characters, which can fit within half the browser window (so that there
are at least two comments which can appear at the same time). Users
can only comment on a book if they’ve purchased it, and may select
whether they show their nickname (defined in their profile) or remain
anonymous.
6 Wish List
Management
Users can create and have 3 different wish lists which can have books moved to
from the primary list.
DESCRIPTION: There will be a section called wish lists, in which the user can create
up to 3 new lists and give them different names. Each list can show the items that
have been added to the list and each item can be added to the cart. Items can be
added to the different lists from the item details page. Items can be removed from
any list in this section. Items can be transferred from one wish list to another.
The grading will be split into team components and group components. Each feature will be owned by a team member.
Each member will be graded for the completion and implementation of the feature that they own. This means that
although you will earn an overall team grade from the team components, each person in the team will be responsible
for a feature being done. If the feature is no completed, the individual who owns the feature will not receive the
implementation portion of the grade.
How will the group develop the web application?
The team will use scrum, which is an agile methodology used to develop software. You will need to review Lecture 1
Scrum to become familiar, but here is a summary:
The team will develop the application in timeboxed intervals known as Sprints. Each Sprint has a start date and an end
date. At the beginning of the sprint, the team conducts a sprint planning meeting, in which they discuss and estimate
what is the functionality that they will implement during that Sprint. The functionality will be implemented by breaking
down the features into user stories. A user story is a description what the software must do, the benefit and the
acceptance criteria. During the sprint, the team will meet through a meeting known as the standup or daily scrum, in
which each team member mentions what they are working on, what they have accomplished and any impediments. It is
expected that the team does at least 2 standup meetings each week. Finally, after the sprint has finished, the team hosts
a Sprint Review, a meeting in which they demo (show) the work that was completed during the sprint. After the Review,
the team performs a Sprint Retrospective (Retro) in which they discuss what has gone well and what can be improved.
It’s a chance for the team to incorporate improvements for the next Sprint. After completing the Sprint Retrospective,
they will then schedule the sprint planning meeting for the next sprint and the process starts again.
Roles:
The teams will consist of 6 people which will be the following during each sprint:
4 Developers: The developers will be responsible for creating their feature and writing their own users stories.
1 Product Owner: This will be an alternating role each sprint. This person will review the backlog of all the user stories
written by developers and make sure they meet the requirements of the features. They will be responsible for asking
any questions for that sprint regarding product functionality to the instructor. This will be a shared role as it is expected
that they also pull in some stories for development
1 Scrum Master: Another alternating role each sprint. The scrum master will be the lead person who oversees removing
any impediments and bringing up any issues to the instructor during the sprint. This will be a shared role as it is expected
that they also pull in some stories for development.
The team will have a different Product Owner and Scrum Master in each sprint, so everyone will have an opportunity to
work under each role.
Velocity:
Velocity is the measurement of how much work will be done. We will use hour units to estimate our work. So, if a
person is working on a given user story that will take them 6 hours to achieve, this will be the estimated effort of their
user story:
A User Story is a description of the development task that has to be done, so the teams will have multiple user stories
and hour estimate to each user story.
Each team will calculate their capacity (how much work they can do) for the sprint in the following manner:
Each developer is expected to work 4 hours a week, so each developer will have an 8-hour allocation per Sprint.
So, 6 developers * 8 = 48 combined hours of work for each a team per Sprint.
The product owner during the sprint will be in charging of grooming the backlog and breaking down the features into
user stories.
Timeline:
The project will be completed in 5 sprints, each lasting 2 weeks. Sprint 1 will start on the 3rd week of class.
• First Day of Class: 1/6
• Live Kickoff Meeting with Instructor before Sprint 1 (Two weeks after): 1/19
• Sprint 1 1/19 - 2/1 Sprint Review 2/1(Post documents by 10pm in your folder)
• Sprint 2 2/2 – 2/15 Sprint Review 2/15 (Record your demo and post documents by 10pm in your team
forum)
• Sprint 3 2/16- 2/29 Sprint Review 3/1 (Live System Demo on Google Hangouts)
• Sprint 4 3/01 – 3/14 Sprint Review 3/14 (Record your demo and post documents by 10pm in your folder)

Note: Your demo must be recorded as a group and should be no more than 8 minutes. All video files must be uploaded
in a compressed format (mp4). If you miss attending/recording 2 or more system demos, you will NOT be eligible for the
group component (60 points).
Deliverables
There will be multiple deliverables for this project, but what I value most is a working project which will be demoed to
me though online meetings. When the project is completed, you will have.
1. Source Code for Project in GitHub
2. Documents for Scrum Ceremonies
3. UML Diagrams for project
4. Recordings of Reviews (if they cannot be done live)
5. Final Demo completed (Will happen after Sprint 5 is completed)
The source code should be checked into Github. Please make sure everyone has an account.
Scrum Documents
During each Sprint, each team will perform the following scrum ceremonies:
- Daily Standup: A quick 5-minute meeting in which the team members discuss what they accomplished the since
they last met and what they plan to work on. Also, any impediments are brought up. You are required to have 2
standups every week. The team can determine what day and time they will meet.
- Sprint Planning: A meeting to determine which of the backlog items will get pulled into the upcoming sprint.
This document will keep the details of the user stories that will be worked on during the sprint.
- Sprint Review: A meeting to showcase the completed stories to the stakeholders. This is the only meeting that
the I will attend. All team members should attend this meeting. If they cannot attend they need to record a
video of the progress of their feature.
- Sprint Retrospective: A Meeting to determine what went right during the sprint and what can be improved.
During each ceremony, the team must keep notes and complete the scrum documents templates in each sprint. The
documents will be uploaded to your group’s forum during each sprint.
è Team 1 Discussion
o Sprint 1
§ Standup document
§ SprintPlanning document
§ SprintReview document
§ SprintRetro document
